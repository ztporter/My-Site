						<h1>My Senior Design Project</h1>
						<p>I got to work along with my fellow teammates (Team Rexacopter) on designing a multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle that was capable of aerially 3D mapping an archaeological dig site. Our project was a blast to work on and we learned a great deal about engineering design and how to effectively work as a team. We also learned a great deal about how to crash a quadcopter and continually demonstrated that knowledge through practice flights. But despite several setbacks we managed to build a system that we were all proud of and that got voted the best out of all 12 projects by our faculty and advisors.</p>

						<h1>My Coding Projects</h1>
						<p>I started off programming in high school when I took a class on Java and now I've picked up a few other languages through college, mainly C++, Python, and HTML, but I've also dabbled in Ruby, Javascript, Coffeescript, and Rails. I've written a good deal of code for my classes and some other scripts and games just for personal pleasure. There's a hubot script in Coffeescript that searches Yelp for some tasty local food, a couple Risk simulators in Python so that you can make more informed decisions as a top general, a large "Nethack-ish" style game in C++ that has lots of different dungeons and a strange Zombie Bear theme, a hangman game in Python, and some other random scripts that are typically me trying not to forget how to code. You can check all of these out on my Github page.</p>
