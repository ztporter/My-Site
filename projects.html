					<h1>Coding Projects</h1>
					<p style="font-size:16px">I started off programming in high school when I took an AP computer science class in Java, and now I've picked up several other languages through college. I'm most experienced in C++, Python, C, and HTML but I've also written scripts in Ruby, Javascript, Coffeescript, and Rails. For embedded systems I've mainly programmed ARM processors using the KEIL uVision IDE which uses either C or assembly (depending on how difficult you want to make it for yourself.) In addition to my classwork I've also written several scripts and programs just for personal pleasure. There's a hubot script in Coffeescript that searches Yelp for some tasty local food, a couple Risk simulators in Python so that you can make more informed decisions as a top general, a large "Nethack-ish" style game in C++ that has lots of different dungeons and a strange Zombie Bear theme, a hangman game in Python, and some other random scripts that I wrote so that I could try to not forget how to code. You can check out all of these and more on my Github page.</p>

					<h1>My Senior Design Project</h1>
					<p>I got to work along with my fellow teammates (Team Rexacopter) on designing a multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle that was capable of aerially 3D mapping an archaeological dig site. Our project was a blast to work on and we learned a great deal about engineering design and how to effectively work as a team. We also learned a great deal about how to crash a quadcopter and continually demonstrated that knowledge through practice flights. But despite several setbacks we managed to build a system that we were all proud of and that got voted the best out of all 12 projects by our faculty and advisors.</p>
