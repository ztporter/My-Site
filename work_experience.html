				<h1>Work Experience</h1>
				<p style="font-size:16px">As a recent graduate from the University of Kentucky with my B.S. in Electrical Engineering I haven't yet held a full time electrical engineering position. However, I did work several different jobs while attending college, in addition to completing my course work, and spent my summers interning or working as well. My most recent/relevant positions held are listed on this page, but if you'd like more information about my experience feel free to look over my <a href="Zachary_Porter_Resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> or checkout the link below to my LinkedIn page.</p>

					<h3>Student Researcher</h3>

					<p style="font-size:16px"><b>Supervisor: Dr. James Lumpp | <a href="mailto:jel@uky.edu">jel@uky.edu</a></b></p>
					<p style="font-size:16px">I worked in the <a href="http://ssl.engineering.uky.edu/" target="_blank">Space Systems Lab </a> as a student researcher funded by a NASA EPSCoR grant to rebuild a previous CubeSat, Ky-Sat 2, for a launch off of the International Space Station. I collaborated with other students to redesign the electric power system used on the satellite which included the solar panels, battery modules, battery protection circuitry, and telemetry monitoring. I used Altium to design the printed circuit boards for the EPS as well as the solar module boards, and to capture the circuit schematics. We also disassembled the previous satellite to test the radio and other parts for functionality, and redesigned the inhibit system of the satellite to comply with new regulations.

					<h3>Software Development Intern</h3>
					<p style="font-size:16px"><b>CirrusMio Inc. | Lexington,Ky | Nov 2014 - Feb 2015</b></p>

					<p style="font-size:16px">As a software development intern at <a href="http://cirrusmio.com/" target="_blank">CirrusMio </a>I worked 10-15 hours a week during the school year on various projects. Along with a team of other interns we designed a new ticketing system using Ruby on Rails to help the company better serve its customers. The company is full of incredible people who taught me a great deal about using Linux and Github to develop and maintain large coding projects in an effective manner. I contributed to the company by responding to customer tickets associated with the various projects, identifying bugs within the code, and implementing minor fixes in some of the projects which largely used Ruby, HTML, and Javascript.</p>

					<h3>Undergraduate Researcher</h3>
					<p style="font-size:16px"><b>University of Kentucky | Lexington,Ky | Mar 2013 - Aug 2014</b></p>
					<p style="font-size:16px"><b>Supervisor: Dr. James Lumpp | <a href="mailto:jel@uky.edu">jel@uky.edu</a></b></p>
					<p style="font-size:16px">As an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering I worked on various aerospace projects in the Space Systems Lab as an undergraduate student researcher. I developed a payload for a high altitude balloon launch that utilized a GPS and servo motor controlled by an Arduino to deploy a tray of aerogel for micrometeorite capture and then reseal the tray before descending. The full details of the project are available <a href="http://idea.engr.uky.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=projects:active:spacecowboy:workspace:default" target="_blank">here</a>. I also learned how to use Altium Designer to capture circuit schematics and design PCB's for various circuits including telemetry chips, embedded circuits, and an arm tracking device. Most of the projects in the lab focused on embedded systems so I learned how to program ARM microcontrollers using the Keil uVision IDE, Arduinos, and other scripts in Python or Matlab for data processing.</p>

					<p style="font-size:16px">As a summer intern with the student ministry team at <a href="http://www.cumcmemphis.org/students" target="_blank">CUMC</a> I was responsible for helping to plan and organize events for the student ministry and to invest into the lives of the students. I was assigned the 9th to 10th grade guys as my focus group and essentially spent as much time with them as possible to both teach them the Christian worldview in a way they could relate to and to model for them a life that is devoted to following Christ.</p>
